# Simple Android Switch

This is a simple design for an Android switch.

## Implementation

The switch has been implemented using a RadioGroup and two internal RadioButtons.

The radio buttons are pulled together with a background drawable, which gives the impression of a switch.


Toggling one of the radio buttons triggers an animation which changes the background (using a TransitionDrawable) and shows the O/I buttons.

No swipe functionality has been included at this stage.
